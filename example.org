This video is a short demonstration of my work in NeosVR.
It is drone manipulated with voice recognision.
The demo starts at mpv:23.

When I speak some specific word, the drone goes foward (mpv:30).

In order to change the word, you should change variable shown at mpv:0:50.

The demo also shows intergration with Jax's wrist utility at mpv:1:37.
